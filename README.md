# hopperStopper

This shiny app checks a SQLite database, in which users can save new studies, tasks and add participants. 
It provides the user with feedback about whether a potential study participant has already taken part in a previous study.
Names are stored as SHA256 hashes.

A demo version is available at http://jcpsantiago.shinyapps.io
